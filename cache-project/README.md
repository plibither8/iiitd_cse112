# n-Way Cache Simulator

## Problem Text

A cache of size S with CL as the number of cache lines and block size B is to be built. S, CL, and B are in powers of 2. Write a program that allows loading into cache and searching cache using:

* Direct mapping
* Associative memory
* n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.

Any programming language (of your choice) can be used.

### Additional points

* Inputs: S, CL, B, n
* For Read: Address
* Write: Address, Data

Addressing will be mapping dependent.

Output: we can print the entire cache structure.
On which location which data is present.
The mechanism to read/write operation also should be according to cache.
